- 👋 Hi! I’m José Tafla, a passionate technical program & project manager, enthusiastic agile servant leader, and curious software engineer. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/taflaj) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtafla).
- 👀 I’m interested in all things technology, including generative AI and decentralized systems.
- 🧑‍💼 As a professional, my forte is in delivery management. For the past 20 years, I've held various roles including technical program/project manager, agile leader, business and solutions architect, and software engineer/application developer across multiple industries. Throughout my career, I've consistently delivered successful solutions and business benefits by leveraging innovative technology. My international experience includes managing offshore teams and implementing successful solutions in foreign countries.
  - As the primary point of contact for my teams and initiatives, I've led cross-functional teams concurrently, negotiated scope and managed stakeholder expectations, and ensured successful delivery within specified schedules, budgets, and quality constraints. I've collaborated closely with business owners to define solution objectives, requirements, and priorities, always aiming to deliver the highest value and address their most pressing business needs.
  - Throughout my career, I've facilitated meetings with project stakeholders, including C-level executives, and prepared thorough status reports. I've coordinated efforts with areas such as Infrastructure, DevOps, Software Engineering & Application Development, Quality, Enterprise Architecture, Customer Success, and vendors. I've also been an active member of the corporate PMO, defining standards and processes, improving existing processes, and finding new ways to increase benefits for customers.
- 💻 As a developer, I’m constantly improving on my Python and Go skills, using [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) as inspiration and to keep my mind sharp. I'm also looking forward to learning Rust and Codility, depending on my next endeavor. Being the curious person I am, and considering I'm a strong advocate towards functional programming, I have Elixir on my radar. In my spare time, I've been studying data science.
  - I've been tinkering with [suckless tools](https://suckless.org/). I'm currently running dwm and related tools on my [Arch Linux](https://distrowatch.com/arch) machines.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building RESTful APIs using microservices and RPC to support any front-end application you may need.
