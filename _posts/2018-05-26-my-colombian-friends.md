# Apologies

One of the biggest mantras in public speaking is that never, ever, under any circumstances, you should start a speech with an apology. The same applies to written speeches such as this.

There are exceptions, though, such as this one. It has been a little over four decades since we've first met, and there was a significant gap between then and now. During this time, our vision of the world in general and of ourselves in particular has changed dramatically. Suddenly you realize you said things when you should have kept quiet. You also realize you should have said things but you kept quiet. That said: for all my words and silence, and actions and inactions, I humbly ask for your forgiveness.

# Four decades fly by in a split second (except for the last few days)

I left Colombia right after graduating from high school. My dad (of blessed memory), who had been expatriated to Mexico and then Colombia, was asked to return to Brazil. A week or so after graduation, we were flying back to our home country.

From then on, it was normal life: went to the university, met my wife, had a wonderful daughter, and had the usual ups and downs of anyone's professional career. Eventually I had the opportunity to try life in the US and, for no reason other than to give it a chance, started the next chapter.

## The Internet is not just for research and defense

Back in the old days there were plenty of tools to allow us to talk to our dear ones. Some such tools still exist, while others belong in a dusty corner of our memory.

In comes social media, which allows us to become even closer despite the distance. With that, I formed new ties with my former classmates and school buddies.

And so it happened that, through social media and personal interaction, a high school reunion was planned and executed.

That brings me, along with my best half, to Bogotá, a city I used to love back then (and continue to do so), where I had the unique opportunity to meet the friends I used to love back then (and continue to do so).

# Thanks

Books, good manners, and common sense teach us to be thankful and appreciative. When you talk to people, they will give you the time, attention, and message they have for you, and you're expected to thank them for that. Even if they give you the very same whenever you interact, no matter if it's déjà vu all over again, you still have to appreciate whatever they're giving you.

During this past week, you gave me a lot. We had the deepest conversations we had ever had. Maybe not at all. You shared your good moments with me, and even some not as good, but you still made it. Maybe not at all. Maybe you didn't share anything with me. Maybe I didn't share anything with you; in this case, once again, my apologies.

The fact of the matter is that, whether you gave me a lot, not as much, barely anything, or nothing at all, I thank you for that. No matter what, you gave me love, and for that I thank you. Please know that, as imperfect a human being as I'll ever be, I tried to give you all the love I could.

## Thanks (again)

And then there's the organizing committee train. I thank you as well for your outstanding effort. I always prefer to leave names unsaid because I may forget someone, and I don't want to insult you by leaving you out.

Whether you built the tracks for the train, built the train itself, put the train on the track, drove the train, or simply rode the train, please take with you my greatest love and appreciation. You, along with all the passengers, both materially and spiritually on board the train, are the main reason why I'm here today.
