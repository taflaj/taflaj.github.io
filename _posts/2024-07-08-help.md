I'm not ashamed of saying this out loud: "**I NEED YOUR HELP!**"
<!--more-->

I've been unemployed for almost 6 months. I have applied to more than 500 jobs. I have networked with people I know and with people who have never heard of me. I've been to multiple job fairs. I've been using [CareerBuilder](https://www.careerbuilder.com/), [Dice](https://www.dice.com/), [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/), [Google](https://www.google.com), [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/), [JobDiva](https://www.jobdiva.com/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), [Resume-Library](https://www.resume-library.com/), [Talentify](https://www.talentify.io/), [ZipRecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/)… you name it, I've tried, including [AZ Job Connection](https://www.azjobconnection.gov/), [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/), [Braintrust](https://www.usebraintrust.com/), and [Infinite Ranges](https://www.infiniteranges.com/). I've searched directly on corporate career portals. I've walked uninvited into agency and corporate offices. I've applied to positions such as program manager, project manager, delivery manager, scrum master, kanban leader, PMO leader, IT manager, engineering manager, engineering director, software engineer (all levels), and many more, all of which I qualify for. I'm an expert in Waterfall and Agile. I'm proficient in more than 20 programming languages, especially shell and PowerShell scripts, Go, and Python, including Java, C, C++, C#, VB, and JavaScript; if I don't know it, I can learn it fast (I'm a quick learner). I've led teams larger than 100 people and managed budgets in excess of US$20M. I'm willing to relocate to most US states on my own dime and to work any time zone hours. Other than a handful of interviews, I have absolutely NOTHING on the horizon.

And that's why I need your help. If you know of someone who's hiring, please send them my way. If you know of someone who needs part time assistance, be that as a developer or leader, please send them my way. And if you don't know of anyone, then please share this page with whoever you can so as to increase visibility.

I have privileged memory. If you help me, I will remember you, but if you can't help me for whatever reasons, I will remember you kindly.

My name is José Tafla and I'm counting on you.

Thank you dearly!
