When someone tells you they're running Linux on their computer, they're most likely lying. Myself included.

## Operating systems and other software

For a computer to make itself useful, it must run an operating system. Examples include Windows NT (and later) and MacOS.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system), an operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. In other words, an operating system is one or more programs that allow you to use the computer. You may have never thought of it like this, but for example, there's a program that keeps monitoring your mouse movement and notifies other programs it has moved (or not at all); those other programs will draw the pointer at its new location, or delete it altogether.

So the operating system enables you to use the computer, but what are you using it for? Different users have different needs. You may want a web browser to navigate the web, an email client to send and receive email, a spreadsheet to track your finances, and everything else you can think of. PC vendors may create bundles so that you, as end user, don't have to worry about downloading and installing the programs you need. With or without bundles, and depending on the constraints imposed by the operating system you use, you can add or remove other programs as needed.

### Misconceptions

Prior to Windows NT, such as Windows 3 or Windows for Workgroups, Windows was not an operating system. It was a program running on MS-DOS or similar, exposing a number of features not available on standard DOS which could be leveraged by other programs. Depending on the configuration, it could also allow you to open a command prompt inside Windows to run DOS programs. Windows 95, 98, etc. are, indeed, operating systems.

Let the controversy begin: Linux is nothing but a kernel. As such, it's one of the programs that comprise an operating system, but per se it's only a kernel. After the Linux kernel was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991, it was adopted as the kernel for the GNU operating system (a free replacement for Unix)[^1].
