When I ask an AI model to tell me a joke, it tells me a joke. When I ask it to tell me 1,000 dad jokes (which I'm using on my upcoming Dad Joke Competition), it will tell me 1,000 dad jokes. When the kids are visiting, they ask my virtual assistant to tell them a knock-knock joke; sure enough, it will tell them a knock-knock joke.

But are those devices really creating jokes, or merely selecting from curated lists?

## Interactive games

### Elisa

### Guessing game

### SHRDLU

## (Mostly) practical use

### Watson

### Virtual assistants and AI models

Most images on this blog were generated by AI models, especially ChatGPT/OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot. I refuse to use DeepSeek.

Why oh why? Because, until proven otherwise, all your interactions are reported to a foreign government which, in the glimpse of the moment, could become an enemy, using that knowledge against you.

But is DeepSeek funny? Surely! Just ask it what happened at Tian'anmen Square. The joke's on you.

## The road ahead

Will there be a point where AI becomes more inteligent than people? Normally I'd say there isn't, but considering the ever growing stupidity infecting the people of Earth, I'm not as sure. A few examples:
* People voting for certain politicians.
* People supporting the guy who was caught on camera killing the CEO of a major corporation with a shot on his back.
* People who insist in buying cars from the guy who, with support from the nation's president, is killing the government and destroying the country.
* People supporting the terrorist organization that invaded a neighboring country, killed thousands of people, kidnapped hundreds, and keeps playing victim.
* People who know for a fact the world is flat.
* People who are sure that vaccines do more bad than good.
* People who believe in all the charlatans out there.
* People downloading and actively using DeepSeek, Tiktok, and so many eavesdropping tools from a hostile country.
* People supporting the CEO of a social media empire who not only laid off thousand of employees but also insulted them on their way out.

My only hope is that, with time, humanity will realize the mistakes they made and repair whatever they broke. Only then I'll believe that artificial inteligence will not surpass human inteligence.
