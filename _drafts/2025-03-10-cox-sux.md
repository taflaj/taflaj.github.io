If there's one thing I have no tolerance to is when people think I'm stupid. They think that, because I have an accent, I'm not as smart, and they feel compelled to lie to me and give me false information.

## This is how it began

My cable services include:
* Contour TV Preferred (140+ channels)
* DVR (2 shows simultaneously)
* 3 TVs
* 500 Mbps
* Unlimited data

### 5 November 2024

I wake up and, much to my surprise, my internet is awfully slow. Is my wifi broken? I check the router and modem; everything looks fine. I check the speed; **2 Mbps**. Ridiculous! I restart my modem and the speed is 500 Mbps. As expected.

A few hours later, the internet is slow again. Same speed. After restarting the modem, everything is back to normal.

Repeat.

I call the company to report the problem. In parallel to sending me a technician, they offer me 1 Gbps speed for a small upgrade fee; they also assure me my monthly bill will remain the same for 2 years. Why not?

Two days later, the technician comes to evaluate my network. Everything is pristine, but then he checks the pedestal outside my home and it's in very bad shape. The equipment is antiquated and the cables break just by looking at them. He rearranges the cables to avoid any further disruption and walks away. Problem solved. The past several months are uneventful.

### 6 March 2025

Sure enough, and contrary to their assurance, my bill went up.

From this moment on, everything went downhill very fast.
