    "## Declarative vs imperative programming\n",
    "\n",
    "One difference between declarative and imperative programming is that, on the former, you tell the computer <mark>what</mark> to do, while on the latter you tell it <mark>how</mark> to do it. The examples below will give more clarity on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object oriented programming\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP (for short) is one example of imperative programming. You model the data and behavior in classes and, during run time, the program instantiates classes into objects. A class can be viewed as the blueprint of the data you want to handle and how it should behave, while the objects contain the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Four basic principles of OOP:[^1] \n",
    "- **Abstraction**: Modeling the relevant attributes and interactions of entities as classes to define an abstract representation of a system.\n",
    "- **Encapsulation**: Hiding the internal state and functionality of an object and only allowing access through a public set of functions.\n",
    "- **Inheritance**: Ability to create new abstractions based on existing abstractions.\n",
    "- **Polymorphism**: Ability to implement inherited properties or methods in different ways across multiple abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^1]: Source: [Microsoft: Object-Oriented programming (C#)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/oop)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though Python does not fully implement all principles, <mark>everything</mark> in Python is an object. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a=1\n",
    ">>> type(a)\n",
    "<class 'int'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Which means, `a` is an instance of class `int`, therefore an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional programming\n",
    "\n",
    "FP (for short) is one example of declarative programming. These are a few principles:\n",
    "- Pure functions\n",
    "  - Functions must accept at least one argument\n",
    "  - Functions return data or another function\n",
    "  - No loops\n",
    "  - Stateless (whenever the function runs, it's like it's running for the first time; in other words, given the same inputs, the output will always be the same)\n",
    "  - No side effects (when the function runs, <mark>nothing</mark> outside of its scope will change)\n",
    "- Immutable values\n",
    "  - Scalar variables are constant\n",
    "  - If a function needs, for example, to alter an array, then instead it should make an altered copy of the array and return it\n",
    "- Referential transparency\n",
    "  - An expression is called *referentially transparent* if it can be replaced with its corresponding value (and vice-versa) without changing the program's behavior. This requires that the expression be pure: its value must be the same for the same inputs and its evaluation must have no side effects.\n",
    "    - An expression that is not referentially transparent is called *referentially opaque*.[^2]\n",

    "The first problem with the Fibonacci sequence is that there are two recursions: `fibonacci3(n-1)` and `fibonacci3(n-2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other problem, maybe even worse, is that the function keeps recalculating the same value over and over again. As an example, what happens when we run `fibonacci3(30)`? It runs for 29, which runs for 28, 27, 26, etc. **and then** it runs for 28 **AGAIN**! Why can't we reuse what has been previously calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "In comes dynamic programming. One of its principles is to break down a problem into smaller subproblems and solve them on at a time, and then solve the bigger one. In this case, we can use it as an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using dynamic programming. The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.[^3]\n",

    "\n",
    "Tail recursion is defined as a recursive function in which the recursive call is the last statement that is executed by the function. So basically nothing is left to execute after the recursion call.[^4] Let's revisit the definition of `factorial2`:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The early impression is that the call to `factorial2(n-1)` is the last statement, so in principle we're good, but if we look at it in detail, we realize that the result of the call must be multiplied by `n`, therefore this is not tail recursion. The program must save the current context to its stack before calling itself, which results in extra resource utilization. One way of enforcing tail recursion is by creating an additional variable to serve as an accumulator and pass it to an internal function. This allows us to change the implementation **without** changing the function signature, thus preserving the rest of the program."

    "## The Golden Hammer antipattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The Golden Hammer antipattern permeates from a development team's overreliance on a single tool set, pattern, platform, or other component of the development workflow. It is a classic pitfall that any team faces when they have gained some level of expertise in a particular solution or methodology. This antipattern is appropriately summarized using the following adage: \"When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\"[^5]\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main advantages of functional programming is its simplicity. Given the same results for the same inputs, and given there are no side effects, it's easy to debug. Resource consumption and execution time may be issues and must be taken into account. In my past experience as a software engineer, however, I should say that only in rare occasions I dealt with deep recursion levels. The most notable case was so many years ago, when I had to look up data in a hierarchical data structure. Resources were at a premium and my program was crashing at random intervals. My very talented data architect came to the rescue, creating a new database view for me, and my problems went away.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, at the least, that one.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are purely declarative programming languages. Likewise, there are purely imperative programming languages. You *may* be stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, nonetheless, multiparadigm programming languages. You'll have the option to choose how to write your code. Against the Golden Hammer antipattern, remember that you have multiple tools and techniques at your disposal, so do yourself a favor and choose the best one for solving the problem at hand.\n",
